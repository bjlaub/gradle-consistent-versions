improvement:
  description: This change relaxes the precondition constraint that checks that
    configure-on-demand is disabled. We now only require it to be disabled
    when running the "verifyLocks" task, or when invoked with
    "--write-locks".

    This gives projects more flexibility to flag on configure-on-demand in certain 
    scenarios where it might make sense.
